CURDS


I just completed a JS assignment where I created a Bookmark application. This project allowed me to apply fundamental JavaScript concepts in a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application. The bookmark data is stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring persistence. I used minimal HTML and CSS, leveraging Bootstrap for a responsive and clean UI. üìù‚ú®

Key Features:

- CRUD Operations: Add, search, update, and delete bookmarks using JavaScript.
  
- Local Storage: Persistent data across sessions.
  
- Responsive Design: Bootstrap for a modern, flexible layout.
  
- Minimal HTML/CSS: Efficient and simple design.
  
- URL Validation: Implemented with "regex" for accurate input.
